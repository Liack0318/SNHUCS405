# SNHU CS 405 â€“ Secure Coding

This repository contains coursework and projects completed for CS 405: Secure Coding at Southern New Hampshire University. The course focused on integrating security throughout the software development life cycle rather than leaving it until the end. Major themes included the adoption of secure coding standards, risk and cost-benefit analysis, the Zero Trust model, and the development of security policies.

Key artifacts include a Secure Coding Policy Template that defined ten core security principles and ten coding standards based on the SEI CERT C++ guidelines. Projects included implementing buffer overflow mitigation in C++ through boundary checks, exception handling, and input validation to ensure memory protection. Written reflections explored the evaluation of risks and tradeoffs using NIST SP 800-30, adoption of Zero Trust practices as described in NIST SP 800-207, and policy implementation aligned with ISO/IEC 27001.

Overall, this course strengthened my ability to recognize vulnerabilities, apply industry standards, and document effective policies that improve software security. The skills gained here connect directly to professional practice, emphasizing the need for proactive security planning and consistent coding standards.
